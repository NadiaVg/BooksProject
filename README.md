PROJECT

https://github.com/NadiaVg/BooksProject.git


The project consists of creating an application with Ionic on the frontend, and Spring and MySQL on the backend.

In this case a CRUD is made with images, verified in POSTMAN.

The application consists of 3 sections:

-Home: A randomly generated recommended book is displayed.
